# Understrap 2 (Beta)



## About

Understrap is the renowned open-source WordPress starter theme that combines Underscores with Bootstrap. Trusted by more than 100,000 developers.

**This is Understrap 2.**

Understrap 2 is a _breaking change_ from Understrap, a completely new theme starter that reimagines Understrap from the ground up for a new era of WordPress. Some major changes:

- [x] No more parent/child theme. This is a starter template.
- [x] No more Font Awesome, no more Bootstrap 4 support.
- [ ] No more Customizer settings - everything is definited in the theme.
- [ ] Native Theme.json (and block editor) support
- [ ] Heavier use of block template parts for areas like the 404 page
- [ ] Major overhaul of the bulky include files like template tags
- [ ] Slightly more modern PHP
- [ ] Snappier build process (perhaps using more modern WordPress)
- [ ] Other ideas? Submit an issue or PR.
